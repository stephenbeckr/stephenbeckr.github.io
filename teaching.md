## Summer STEM camp (Aurora and Longmont Colorado)
Thanks to CU Office of Outreach and Northrop Grumman for supporting this
- We did this again in July 2022 and 2023; these years, I didn't help with teaching but organized a visit to CU to see research groups
- Happening again in July 2021 (but only in Longmont/online): see [Innovation Center Super STEM camps](https://innovation.svvsd.org/summercamps) website to register. 
  - [Github repo](https://github.com/cu-applied-math/stem-camp-notebooks) with our materials
  - [2021 promo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19b1qO9498OsLW2q96yyKDlqdSSpZHmsC/view?usp=sharing) and the [end-of-week summary video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GwUIAFdbVicUUwjaP-1u-ROMvqrGcu04/view?usp=sharing) professionally produced by the St Vrain Valley School District
- Here is the [Aurora/Longmont STEM camp website](http://stemcamp.aurorak12.org/).
In 2020, we also have [TCP website](https://www.colorado.edu/program/tcp/CU-SVVSD-NG-summer-camps-2020) and [St Vrain 5-Day Superstem camps](https://innovation.svvsd.org/superstemcamps)
- Pictures from 2017, 2018 and 2019 (no picture taken in 2020 since camp is online due to COVID-19)

## Statistics, Optimization, Machine Learning seminar
I have been co-running the Stat/Opt/ML seminar with Raf Frongillo (CS) continuously since 2016 (with a break AY 20/21 for COVID-19, and break Fall 2022 for sabbatical).

Here is the [StatOptML seminar website](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/statoptml/)
