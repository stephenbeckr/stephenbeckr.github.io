# About us

<!-- <img style="float: left;" src="/assets/img/CU_logo_matlab.jpg"> -->
Stephen Becker is an associate professor of [applied mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/). Previously he was a Herman Goldstine Postdoctoral fellow in Mathematical Sciences at IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, NY, and a postdoctoral fellow via the [Fondation Sciences Mathématiques de Paris](http://www.sciencesmaths-paris.fr/) at Paris 6. He received his PhD in 2011 from Caltech under [Emmanuel Candès](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/).

More information about us at [people](people); we also have the old (and infrequently updated)  [google site member page](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/becker/members).

## Group Research site

Please note: this website `amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker` (also mirrored via github pages) is being (slowly) deprecated in favor of a more homogenous [faculty website](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/becker).

Yet another website is our
[research group website](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/becker/) with public information about our research activities as well as our group's internal collaboration tools.

My CV is on my [CU Experts Profile page](https://experts.colorado.edu/display/fisid_154263).
