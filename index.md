<!-- # About us -->

<!-- <img style="float: left;" src="/assets/img/CU_logo_matlab.jpg"> -->
Stephen Becker is an associate professor of [applied mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/). Previously he was a Herman Goldstine Postdoctoral fellow in Mathematical Sciences at IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, NY, and a postdoctoral fellow via the [Fondation Sciences Mathématiques de Paris](http://www.sciencesmaths-paris.fr/) at Paris 6. He received his PhD in 2011 from Caltech under [Emmanuel Candès](https://candes.su.domains/).
